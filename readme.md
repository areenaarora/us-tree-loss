## Potential headline
A look at tree cover loss and subsequent CO2 emissions in the US in 2020

### Goal
1. To be able to tell a comprehensive story with just data
2. Make a strong visual piece
3. ^To this end, start with charts (use Altair maybe?) and perhaps add some maps in a scrollytelling format?

### Initial questions to ask the dataset
1. Which states lost the most tree cover in 2020?
2. Which states had the most amount of carbon emmissions in 2020?

### Initial findings
1. Alabama had the highest tree cover loss in 2001 — when our data starts
2. California had the most tree cover loss in 2020 — assuming because of fires?
3. California and Oregon had the most emissions in 2020

### Data sources
1. [Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/)
2. [Census](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2010/geo/state-area.html) for each state's area
